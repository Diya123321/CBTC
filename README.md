<h1>Task 1:Iris Flower Classification</h1><br>
<p>In this task ,I trained my model in classifying the Iris Flowers in three categories(Iris-sentosa,Iris-versicolor,Iris-virginica) on the basis of there sepal dimensions and petal dimensions.For thia purpose I used KNN (k nearest neighbor) model as it best fitted for this classification and provided me with 100% accuracy and precision </p><br>
<h1>Task 2:Email Spam Detection </h1><br>
<p>In this task, I trained my model to classify and identify emails in two categories named as spam and not spam .For this task , I performed each and every model on the dataset to find the highest accuracy and precision .I got maximum accuracy of 97% and precision of 100% via multinomial naive bayes model .I even tried making a GUI of it using streamlit libraries and pycharm software .  </p><br>
<p>At the end it was a great experience working with Cipherbyte Technologiesas instead of just theory learning I was working on the Practical projects</p>
